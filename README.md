# Creating an Active Directory Domain

Even though I have experience doing this in the past, I wanted to take full control this time when creating an Active Directory Domain within a Windows Server. While the task by itself sounds challenging, the whole process was made easier and more rewarding with the help of VirtualBox. By leveraging the power of virtualization, I was able to simulate a network environment and practice essential IT skills in a safe and controlled environment. Setting up the domain involved configuring the server, creating user accounts, and implementing group policies to manage network resources effectively. Overall, this project helped me deepen my understanding of network administration and sharpen my troubleshooting skills.

## Lessons Learned & Future Plans

Through creating a virtual machine, setting up an Active Directory Domain, and managing users and permissions within that domain, I've gained a deeper understanding of network administration concepts and practices. Working with VirtualBox and Windows Server 2019 allowed me to simulate real-world network environments, which was invaluable for honing my skills in system configuration and troubleshooting. I learned how to effectively create and manage virtual machines, which is essential for testing software, running multiple operating systems, and maintaining a flexible IT infrastructure.

Setting up an Active Directory Domain taught me the importance of centralized management in network environments. By creating users and groups and assigning permissions, I could control access to resources and ensure security across the network. This hands-on experience not only reinforced my knowledge of Active Directory concepts but also improved my ability to navigate and utilize management tools like Active Directory Users and Computers and Group Policy Management Console. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical skills and prepared me for more complex networking challenges in the future. For further practice and experimental reasons, I will be attempting to automate certain tasks within Active Directory in a later project.
